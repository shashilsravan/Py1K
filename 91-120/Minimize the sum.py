# Minimize The Sum
# Problem Description
# Given an array of integers, perform atmost K operations so that the sum of elements of final array is minimum. An operation is defined as follows -
#
# Consider any 1 element from the array, arr[i].
#
# Replace arr[i] by floor(arr[i]/2).
#
# Perform next operations on updated array.
#
# The task is to minimize the sum after atmost K operations.
#
# Constraints
# 1 <= N, K <= 10^5.
#
# Input
# First line contains two integers N and K representing size of array and maximum numbers of operations that can be performed on the array respectively.
#
# Second line contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of the array, arr.
#
# Output
# Print a single integer denoting the minimum sum of the final array.
#
# Time Limit
# 1
#
# Examples
# Example 1
#
# Input
#
# 4 3
#
# 20 7 5 4
#
# Output
#
# 17
#
# Explanation
#
# Operation 1 -> Select 20. Replace it by 10.
#
# New array = [10, 7, 5, 4]
#
# Operation 2 -> Select 10. Replace it by 5.
#
# New array = [5, 7, 5, 4].
#
# Operation 3 -> Select 7. Replace it by 3.
#
# New array = [5,3,5,4].
#
# Sum = 17.
